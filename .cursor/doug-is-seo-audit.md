# üîç SEO Audit Report: [Doug.is](https://www.doug.is)

## 1. ‚úÖ Executive Summary

Your site is fast, technically clean, and personally written ‚Äî strong foundations. However, as a new site with few backlinks, thin metadata, and a lack of structured content around your service offerings, Google has little context on what to rank you for.

### Top Recommendations
- Define and target clear keywords around founder support and advisory services
- Expand your project pages to improve topical authority and conversion
- Connect all major pages through a central sitemap and internal linking
