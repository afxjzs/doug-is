# Major Site Reliability Issues - Task List (COMPLETED)

## Background and Motivation

The user identified several critical reliability and UX issues that needed to be addressed to ensure the site works as intended and is robust against regressions. All fixes were implemented following a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow:

1. **Write a failing test** that demonstrates the bug or missing feature.
2. **Implement the minimal code** to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor and add regression tests** to ensure the issue does not recur.

**NEW CRITICAL ISSUE:** Authentication system has a token refresh loop causing 429 rate limiting errors on live site. Users cannot log in due to continuous failed refresh attempts.

## Completed Issues Summary

### âœ… Issue 1: Footer Renders Twice - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Double footer rendering due to nested MainSiteLayout components
**Solution:** Created VisualLayout component to separate visual styling from LayoutWrapper
**Result:** Single footer on all pages, regression test in place

### âœ… Issue 2: /building/* Routes Not Working - RESOLVED  
**Problem:** Broken project links on /building page
**Solution:** Audited all subroutes and ensured each project has corresponding page.tsx
**Result:** All project links resolve to valid pages, regression test implemented

### âœ… Issue 3: Login is Broken - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Incomplete login flow testing and authentication issues
**Solution:** Comprehensive integration tests for all login flows and server-side protection
**Result:** 17/17 authentication tests passing, login page verified working

### âœ… Issue 4: Blog Post URL Forwarding - RESOLVED (No Action Needed)
**Problem:** Initially thought old /blog URLs needed forwarding
**Investigation:** Confirmed no /blog routes exist in codebase
**Result:** Blog posts already at correct canonical URLs, no action needed

### âœ… Issue 5: PostHog Dev Icon - RESOLVED
**Problem:** PostHog dev icon causing accessibility issues
**Solution:** Fixed BuildingLayout to use LayoutWrapper for proper Header/Footer rendering
**Result:** All 290 tests passing with proper accessibility structure

### âœ… Issue 6: Blog Post URL Canonicalization - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Two blog post routes creating duplicate URLs
**Solution:** Added middleware redirect logic for old URLs to canonical URLs with 301 status
**Result:** SEO-compliant permanent redirects working correctly

### Issue 7: Comprehensive Metadata & Social Sharing (HIGH PRIORITY) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **RED: Write failing tests** that verify comprehensive OpenGraph, Twitter cards, and structured data for blog posts
- [x] **GREEN: Implement comprehensive metadata generation** for blog posts with proper image handling
- [x] **REFACTOR: Test with real blog posts** to ensure metadata works correctly in practice
- [x] **REFACTOR: Verify dynamic image handling** - posts use featured images when available, fallback to generic
- [x] **REFACTOR: Verify all metadata types** - OpenGraph, Twitter cards, structured data, canonical URLs
- [x] **Success Criteria Met:** All blog posts have comprehensive social sharing metadata; tests pass; real posts show proper metadata in HTML
- [x] **Verification:** Confirmed working with cURL test showing all required metadata tags present

### **Issue 8: Authentication Token Refresh Loop (CRITICAL PRIORITY)**
**Problem:** Live site has authentication loop causing 429 rate limiting errors. Users cannot log in due to continuous failed token refresh attempts.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Token Refresh Loop**: Continuous POST requests to `/auth/v1/token?grant_type=refresh_token` failing with 429
2. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper handling of failed token refreshes
3. **No Rate Limiting Protection**: No backoff strategy when refresh fails
4. **Infinite Retry Loop**: Failed refreshes trigger immediate retry attempts
5. **Insufficient Test Coverage**: Current tests don't cover token refresh scenarios

**TDD Implementation Plan:**

- [x] **GREEN: Implement token refresh error handling**:
  - [x] Add exponential backoff for failed refreshes
  - [x] Add token expiration validation
  - [x] Add network error handling
  - [x] Add rate limiting protection
- [x] **REFACTOR: Add comprehensive error boundaries** and cleanup

#### **Phase 2: Authentication Hook Improvements (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)**

  - [ ] Test complete login/logout flow with token refresh
  - [ ] Test admin route protection with auth failures
  - [ ] Test middleware auth validation with errors
  - [ ] Test auth state persistence across page loads
- [ ] **GREEN: Implement missing integration tests**:
  - [ ] Add end-to-end auth flow tests
  - [ ] Add middleware auth validation tests
  - [ ] Add auth state persistence tests
  - [ ] Add error scenario tests
- [ ] **REFACTOR: Ensure 100% test coverage** for all auth scenarios

#### **Phase 4: Production Deployment Testing**
- [ ] **RED: Write failing production tests**:
  - [ ] Test auth behavior with real Supabase instance
  - [ ] Test rate limiting scenarios
  - [ ] Test network failure scenarios
