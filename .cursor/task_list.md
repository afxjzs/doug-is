# Draft Preview Feature Implementation - Task List

## Background and Motivation

The user requested to add a "create post" button to the admin dashboard and posts management page. After implementing this, the user requested to enter planner mode to inspect the admin and post structure and create a complete, TDD-focused plan to implement draft preview functionality for unpublished posts.

**Key Requirements:**
- Draft preview should be accessible only to logged-in admins
- Draft posts should show a clear visual indicator (banner/warning)
- URL structure: `/admin/posts/[id]/preview`
- View Draft buttons should appear in admin UI for unpublished posts
- Proper authentication and security controls
- TDD approach with comprehensive test coverage

**User Preferences Confirmed:**
- âœ… URL structure: `/admin/posts/[id]/preview` (confirmed)
- âœ… Feature scope: Admin-only draft preview with visual indicators (confirmed)
- âœ… Visual design: Amber/yellow styling for draft indicators (confirmed)
- âœ… Testing priority: Comprehensive TDD coverage (confirmed)

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Technical Challenges:**
1. **Server Component Testing**: Draft preview pages are server components, requiring integration testing approach
2. **Authentication Integration**: Must integrate with existing unified auth system
3. **Type Safety**: Admin posts have different types than public posts (`published_at` can be null)
4. **Security**: Admin-only access with proper redirects and error handling
5. **UI/UX Consistency**: Draft indicators must match existing cyberpunk design theme

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Use existing `PostView` component with `isDraft` prop for draft rendering
- Leverage unified auth system for admin access control
- Implement proper error handling with `notFound()` for missing posts
- Use admin Supabase client for fetching unpublished posts
- Follow established Route Groups pattern for URL structure

## Lessons

**TDD Best Practices for Next.js Projects:**
- Server components require integration testing approach, not direct Jest testing
- Mock complex dependencies (react-markdown, Next.js Image/Link) to avoid module loading issues
- Test authentication logic and data fetching separately from component rendering
- Focus on testable aspects: URL generation, type transformations, error handling
- Ensure test expectations match actual component behavior, not idealized scenarios

**Draft Preview Implementation Lessons:**
- Use admin Supabase client for fetching unpublished posts
- Transform AdminPost types to Post types for component compatibility
- Implement proper error handling with `notFound()` for missing posts
- Use `isDraft` prop pattern for conditional rendering in components
- Follow established Route Groups pattern for URL structure

**Test File Organization:**
- Place test files in standard directories that Jest recognizes
- Follow established patterns: `src/components/__tests__/` for component tests
- Avoid deeply nested test directories that Jest may not find
- Use descriptive test file names that match the functionality being tested
