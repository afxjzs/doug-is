# Major Site Reliability Issues - Task List (COMPLETED âœ…)

## Background and Motivation

The user identified several critical reliability and UX issues that needed to be addressed to ensure the site works as intended and is robust against regressions. All fixes were implemented following a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow:

1. **Write a failing test** that demonstrates the bug or missing feature.
2. **Implement the minimal code** to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor and add regression tests** to ensure the issue does not recur.

**CURRENT STATUS:** âœ… **COMPLETED** - All 350 tests are now passing!

## Completed Issues Summary

### âœ… Issue 1: Footer Renders Twice - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Double footer rendering due to nested MainSiteLayout components
**Solution:** Removed redundant MainSiteLayout wrapper in individual pages
**Tests:** Added comprehensive footer rendering tests

### âœ… Issue 2: Hardcoded URLs - RESOLVED
**Problem:** URLs hardcoded to localhost instead of using dynamic domain detection
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive domain detection utilities with environment variable support
**Tests:** Added domain detection tests and updated all metadata tests

### âœ… Issue 3: Metadata Inconsistencies - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Inconsistent site names, Twitter handles, and descriptions across pages
**Solution:** 
- Standardized site name to lowercase "doug.is" across all pages
- Updated Twitter handle to "@glowingrec" consistently
- Fixed metadata descriptions to include "Douglas E. Rogers"
- Implemented proper trailing slash handling for canonical URLs
**Tests:** Updated all metadata tests to expect correct values

### âœ… Issue 4: Jest Configuration Issues - RESOLVED
**Problem:** ES module compatibility issues with react-markdown and remark-gfm
**Solution:** 
- Added proper module mocks for react-markdown and remark-gfm
- Updated Jest configuration to handle ES modules correctly
**Tests:** All tests now run without configuration errors

### âœ… Issue 5: PublishButton Redirect Test - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Test failing due to window.location mocking issues
**Solution:** Implemented proper window.location mocking that doesn't interfere with other tests
**Tests:** All PublishButton tests now pass

## Final Test Results

**ðŸŽ‰ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!**

- **Total Tests:** 350 âœ…
- **Passing Tests:** 350 âœ… (100% success rate)
- **Failing Tests:** 0 âœ…
- **Test Coverage:** 21.87%

## Key Achievements

1. **Fixed Bad Titles** - Updated metadata descriptions to include "Douglas E. Rogers" as expected
2. **Fixed Dynamic URL System** - Implemented proper `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable support
3. **Updated Twitter Handle** - Changed from "@douglasrogers" to "@glowingrec" consistently across all pages
4. **Standardized Site Name** - Changed from "Doug.is" to lowercase "doug.is" across all pages
5. **Fixed Jest Configuration** - Resolved ES module issues with react-markdown and remark-gfm
6. **Fixed PublishButton Test** - Implemented proper window.location mocking

## Lessons Learned

- **TDD Workflow**: Writing tests first helped identify and fix issues systematically
- **Environment Variables**: Proper use of `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` for dynamic URL generation
- **Jest Configuration**: ES modules require special handling in Jest configuration
- **Window Location Mocking**: Need to use getter/setter approach for reliable testing
- **Metadata Consistency**: All metadata must be consistent across all pages
