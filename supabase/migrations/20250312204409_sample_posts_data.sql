    'Vaporwave is an aesthetic that emerged in the early 2010s, combining elements of 80s and 90s design with glitch art, cyberpunk, and retro computing.\n\nThe style is characterized by its use of neon colors, particularly pink and cyan, retro computer graphics, glitch effects, and references to early internet culture and obsolete technology.\n\nTo create a vaporwave design:\n\n1. Start with a dark background, preferably black or deep purple\n2. Add neon gradients in pink, purple, and cyan\n3. Incorporate grid patterns reminiscent of 80s sci-fi\n4. Use glitch effects and distortion\n5. Add retro computer graphics or statues\n\nVaporwave is more than just a visual styleâ€”it''s a nostalgic commentary on consumer capitalism and technology.',
