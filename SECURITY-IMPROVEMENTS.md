# Security Improvements for doug.is

This document outlines the security improvements implemented to protect sensitive Supabase keys and enhance overall application security.

## Key Security Improvements

1. **Separated Supabase Clients**
   - `publicClient.ts`: Uses the anon key for client-side operations (read-only)
   - `serverClient.ts`: Uses the service role key for server-side operations only

2. **Server-Side Data Operations**
   - Moved all data mutation operations to server-side components
   - Implemented server actions for secure data handling
   - Prevented service role key exposure to clients

3. **Contact Form Security**
   - Replaced direct API fetch with server action
   - Added input validation with Zod
   - Secured database operations with server-side client

4. **Admin Route Protection**
   - Added middleware to block access to admin routes
   - Set up for future authentication implementation

## Environment Variables Management

```
# PUBLIC - Client-side safe (read-only operations)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# PRIVATE - Server-side only (protected operations)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Client-Side Safety**
   - Removed all server role key usage from client components
   - Limited client-side operations to read-only operations

2. **Type Safety**
   - Updated Database type definitions for better type safety
   - Added interface definitions for consistent data access

3. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error handling and fallbacks
   - Enhanced error messages for better debugging

## Future Security Improvements

1. **Authentication System**
   - Implement proper authentication for admin routes
   - Add role-based access control

2. **Database RLS Policies**
   - Review and strengthen Supabase Row Level Security policies
   - Limit permissions of the anon key further

3. **API Security**
   - Add rate limiting to all API routes
   - Implement CSRF protection

4. **Security Headers**
   - Add Content-Security-Policy headers
   - Implement other security headers (X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## How to Verify Security

1. Check that no API or client component uses the service role key
2. Verify all data mutations go through server actions or API routes
3. Confirm admin routes are protected
4. Ensure environment variable segregation is maintained
